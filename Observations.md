After grouping customers based on their cohort month (first month of transactions), SaaS customers from the latest cohorts have processed lower transactions compared to the earlier cohorts in 2013. <br>
Even though Platforms account for most payments processed, Jan 2013 cohort seemed to be driving the majority of these payments. <br>
Somewhat concerning segment as latest cohorts (June & Aug 2013) have signficantly low volume of transactions processed over their active months. Additionally, no active merchants are available in recent months. <br>
Ecom merchants have a variablity in the payments processed through out their lifecycle, this segment is less concerning as the most recent cohort has an increasing engagement with Stripe.
